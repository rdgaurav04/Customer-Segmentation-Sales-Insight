# Customer-Segmentation-Sales-Insight

###  Overview
This project explores customer behavior using:
- **RFM Segmentation** (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)
- **Market Basket Analysis** (Association Rule Mining)
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** with time series, trends, and product/category insights

The goal: Turn raw transactional data into **actionable business insights** that improve **customer retention**, **sales strategy**, and **inventory planning**.

#### Conclusion

This project demonstrates how data-driven strategies can transform raw sales and transaction data into powerful business insights. By integrating Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), RFM segmentation, and Market Basket Analysis, we uncovered:

Who the most valuable and loyal customers are

Which product combinations drive the highest basket value

When and where sales peak, and why

How to design targeted, profitable marketing campaigns

Using tools like Python, KNIME, Excel, and Tableau, this end-to-end approach highlights the value of combining analytics and storytelling to drive decisions in sales, CRM, and retail operations.
